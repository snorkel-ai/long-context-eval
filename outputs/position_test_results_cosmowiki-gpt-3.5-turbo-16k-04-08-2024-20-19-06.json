They need to have good hand-eye coordination, concentration, and the ability to make difficult catches in traffic.\n\n2. Route Running: Wide receivers run specific routes to get open and create separation from the defenders. They need to have good footwork, agility, and the ability to change direction quickly.\n\n3. Blocking: Wide receivers are also responsible for blocking when the team runs the ball. They need to be able to engage with defenders and create running lanes for the ball carrier.\n\n4. Reading Defenses: Wide receivers must be able to read the defense and adjust their routes accordingly. They need to understand coverages and make split-second decisions on the field.\n\n5. Yards after Catch: Once a wide receiver catches the ball, they need to be able to gain yards after the catch. This requires speed, elusiveness, and the ability to break tackles.\n\n6. Communication: Wide receivers need to have good communication with the quarterback and other members of the offense. They need to be able to read the quarterback's signals and make adjustments on the fly.\n\nOverall, the key responsibilities of a striker in American Football, specifically the wide receiver position, are to catch passes, run routes, block, read defenses, gain yards after the catch, and communicate effectively with the rest of the offense.", "position": 14, "context_length": 15499, "model":
